# üí∞ Expense Tracker (Python + SQL)

A simple command-line expense tracker built with Python and SQLite.  
Created as part of my **100 Days of Code** challenge to practice Python programming, database interaction, and CRUD operations.

## ÔøΩ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Balance & Transactions ‚≠ê
**Skills**: Python syntax, variables, file I/O, basic functions
**Goal**: Core functionality with simple data storage
- Set initial balance
- Add transactions (description, amount, date)
- View transaction history
- Calculate current balance
- **Storage**: CSV files or simple text files

### Phase 2: Categories & Organization ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Skills**: Lists, dictionaries, data structures, string manipulation, input validation
**Goal**: Better transaction management
- Add categories to transactions (Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.)
- Filter transactions by category
- **Stretch Goal**: Basic transaction editing/deletion
- **Storage**: Still CSV, but better structured

### Phase 3: SQLite Integration ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Skills**: SQL basics, database design, sqlite3 module, exception handling, data migration
**Goal**: Real database with proper data relationships
- Migrate from CSV to SQLite database
- Create proper database schema
- CRUD operations with SQL queries
- Data validation and error handling
- **Note**: Uses Python's built-in `sqlite3` module - no extra libraries needed!

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Reports ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Skills**: Data analysis, datetime manipulation, aggregation functions, report generation, matplotlib/charts
**Goal**: Comprehensive expense analysis
- Monthly/weekly/daily reports
- Category spending analysis  
- Budget tracking and alerts
- Expense trends and insights
- Data export functionality

### Phase 5: Enhanced Database & Multi-User ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Skills**: Advanced SQL, database relationships, PostgreSQL, security, deployment
**Goal**: Production-ready application
- Multiple related tables (budgets, recurring transactions)
- PostgreSQL integration option
- Advanced querying and analytics
- **Optional/Web Version**: User accounts and authentication (more relevant for web apps)
